## Description

2d platformer game implemented using java's applet libraries. doesn't require anything not pre-baked into JDK.

* Main character sprites from some NES game, repackaged
* Sounds generated from [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/)
* All other sprites by me

## Is applet programming for you?

# No.

Use a game library for game programming, like [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/) and [Slick](http://slick.cokeandcode.com/).

[I have a setup guide for installing LWJGL and Slick](https://github.com/tangmi/environment-setup)
