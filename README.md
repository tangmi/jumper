## description

2d platformer game implemented using java's applet libraries. doesn't require anything not pre-baked into jdk.

* main character sprites from some nes game, repackaged
* sounds generated from [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/)
* all other sprites by me

## is applet programming for you?

# no.

use a game library for game programming. [lwjgl](http://lwjgl.org/), [slick](http://slick.cokeandcode.com/), etc. exist on java.
